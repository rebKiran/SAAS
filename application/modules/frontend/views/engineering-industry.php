                                <p class="c-feature-15-desc"> Driven by accelerated economic growth in emerging markets, overall global demand for energy continues to increase. Electricity demand continues to grow and is estimated to increase by 70% by 2035. </p>
                                <p>
									Large scale investment in energy supply infrastructure is required to replace existing supply capacity and expand to meet growing energy needs. Globally a large number of construction projects are underway to overcome shortages and meet growing demand for electricity.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									The power industry Is also undergoing a transformation as trends are shifting towards emphasis on clean energy and the generation of power from renewable fuels. Fossil fuels remain the dominant source of energy for power generation, forcing Industry players to seek and adopt cleaner production technologies in the face of tightening environmental  legislation.
								</p>
								
								<p>
								For Industry players and other stakeholders grappling with some of the above mentioned issues, SASS can draw on its extensive global experience in the power sector to offer innovative solutions in planning and executing of  infrastructure  expansion and new construction projects;   optimisation of output from current assets and integration of clean power production technologies.
